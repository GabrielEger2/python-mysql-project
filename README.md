# Qt CRUD

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is a code repository for a complete CRUD program with a frontend made using Qt, and a database made using MySQLite3

<h3>Requirements</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In order to locally use this program, you must install the libraries requirements using the following command: 

```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<h3>Expected Output</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Once the code is initialized, a Qt window will appear containing some data entries, buttons, and a table; this table is directly connected to a MySQL database that will be created or loaded when the program starts

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The program can add, update, remove, and search for a user inside the database. The program can access a user inside the database by clicking on its row in the Table; this adds the user info to the entries to be updated or removed

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Finally, when a name is written inside the entry above the table, the term is going to be searched inside the table and scrolled to its location
